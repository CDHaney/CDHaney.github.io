									<p>Publications and journals dedicated to your field of interest are a way to keep up-to-date on all the new developments in the field. You can learn about new inventions, research, or even something cool in your field that you may want to do further research into. As a software engineer, changes to the field occur often, and it's important to try to stay in the know. Below are three important publications related to software engineering that are worth checking out for anyone interested in the field.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Wiley: Information Systems Journal</h2>
									<p>Wiley publishes a variety of technical newsletters and journals, but this one specifically revolves around programming and software engineering topics. In it, there are recent studies, new developments in the field, and even articles dedicated to debating hot-button topics, like artificial intelligence and data privacy. This bimonthly publication is worth taking a look at for an overview of many different topics.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Springer: Empirical Software Engineering</h2>
									<p>The Empirical Software Engineering journal from Springer releases new volumes on a quarterly basis, with are filled with technical articles about various software engineering topics. Unlike Wiley, Springer is dedicated more to the purely technical side of the field, as opposed to the opinionated sites, and thus the articles consist of research reports and techincal articles on a new topic or programming technique. If you're interested in keeping up with the heavily engineering side of software engineering, this journal is the place to look.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</h2>
									<p>As a monthly publication from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, this journal focuses on the results of data and research heavy findings in software engineering and discusses its impact on the software engineering field. Thus, this journal is geared towards the study of the future of software engineering. As a constantly developing field, this journal will provide some useful insights into the field for anyone interested in getting a head start on whatt could be the next big thing in the field.</p>
