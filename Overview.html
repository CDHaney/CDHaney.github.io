									<h2>What is Sotware Engineering?</h2>
									<p>As mentioned on the homepage, software engineering is a field of computer science in which a person develops software. Basically, they're programmers that produce useable products that perform some function. Software engineers are responsible for the creation of all apps, video editing software, music players, anything that you can run on your computer to do something was likely the creation of a team of software engineers.</p>

									<h2>What are the Different Areas in Software Engineering?</h2>
									<p>Since software engineering is such a broad category, there are many different, more specialized areas of software engineering available. Application development works on apps that go into app stores, software testers specialize in trying to break software to find security risks or bugs in a program, and software designers focus on the front-end aspects of software, meaning that they make the interface that the user interacts with nice and friendly, which lets them implement design principles into their software.</p>

									<h2>What Kind of Software Engineering do I Want to do?</h2>
									<p>I've always wanted to do the back-end development of software, the heavy programming side that builds the software from the ground up and makes it as efficicent as possible. I've always love creating things from scratch, so I think that career would suit me quite well. However, as I've taken more design-based classes, such as Professional and Technical Writing, I've found I also enjoy creating the front-end as well, as I get to apply the many design principles I've learned from these classes into my work. Perhaps as I take more classes my preferred career will change, but regardless, it will likely still be in the software engineering field.</p>
