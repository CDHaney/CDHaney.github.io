										<h1>Professional Organizations for Software Engineers</h1>

									<p>Professional organizations and societies are groups of people who all have similar career paths, coming together to talk about their careers and the developments made in their fields. They're designed to encourage friendly discourse, provide professional development, and give you connections to other professionals all at the same time. Below are a list of three professional organizations in the field of computer science and software engineering that struck me as particularly interesting. For links to their websites, simply click on their names.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://www.computer.org/">IEEE Computer Society</a></h2>
									<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a large organization of people dedication to the various aspects of all things hardware, software, and everything in between. The IEEE Computer Society is a subgroup of those people whose main focus is computer science and software engineering research. Being part of this society for $156/year gives you connections with fellow professionals from around the world, research databses, and technical newsletters that will keep you up to date on all the newest developments in software engineering.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization">Association for Computing Machinery</a></h2>
									<p>The ACM is the largest organization in the world, dedicated to all things computer science. For $198/year, you have access to various publications from the cutting edge of computational development, and can participate in various events dedicated to discussion on a variety of topics, including ethics in computer science and technical debates. The ACM also allows you to join the ACM-W, dedicated to the discoeries made by women in computing, free of charge if you are already a member.</p>

									<h2><a href="https://cra.org/">Computing Research Organization</a></h2>
									<p>The CRA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping schools and businesses that do research in computer science and software engineering to make the most out of government subsidies for their research. They provide various types of professional development for students, conduct workshops on the newest technology for employees of businesses, and overall assist in making sure that the companies, laboratories and schools are all aiming for newer and better technical developments. While an individual cannot become a member, as it's designed for larger groups, a person can volunteer to help in events, which would allow them to experience these workshops and professional development trainings firsthand.</p>
