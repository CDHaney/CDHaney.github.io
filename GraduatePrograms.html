									<p>As with any career, a graduate degree will help you excel in the field, by allowing you to work alongside academic professionals and mentors that help you develop professional skills. Of course, some graduate programs will be better than others, whether it be due to the rigor of the coursework, how talented your professors are in that field, or some other criteria. Because of this, it may be difficult to decide what graduate programs to apply for, so below is an overview of the four best graduate programs for software engineers. Keep in mind that for this list, I will be covering which graduate programs provide the best computer science degrees, as that is the most relevant degree for software engineers. For links to the graduate programs at each school, simply click on their respective names down below.</p>

									<h2><a href = "https://cs.stanford.edu/academics/prospective-masters">Stanford University</a></h2>
									<p>Stanford's computer science graduate program requires the student to choose a specific concentration for study, as opposed to allowing generalized study. These concentrations include a couple that I find particularly interesting, like human-computer interaction and "mobile and internet computing," both of which revolve heavily around the basis of software engineering: design and usage of the software by humans. Besides allowing the student to pick a specific area in computer science to go into, the profesors there to be your guides include top names in the field like Donald Knuth, who wrote <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, the widely acclaimed guide to the principles of programming. Overall, the graduate program at Stanford is without a doubt one of the best out there for software engineers.</p>

									<h2><a href = "https://gradadmissions.mit.edu/programs/eecs">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a></h2>
									<p>MIT offers a unique spin on the average computer science graduate degree, as it combines computer science and electrical engineering into the same degree. While the electrical engineering side may not at first seem to be useful for a software engineer, getting a better understanding of how the hardware and the software combine can allow one to create more efficient and overall higher-quality software. MIT's graduate program is worth checking out for those engineers with a dual interest in hardware and software, such as myself.</p>

									<h2><a href = "https://grad.berkeley.edu/program/computer-science/">University of California at Berkeley</a></h2>
									<p>Of all the schools listed so far, UC Berkeley provides the most classic graduate experience of all. Berkeley offers a generalized computer science graduate program, in which you work with professors in the field to develop research pertaining to your area of interest. Of course, just because it's a more stereotypical graduate expereince doesn't mean it's a lackluster program. The staff are all experts in computer science, and many of their alumni have gone on to hold high-level positions around the world, according to their graduate program website. If you're not sure what specifically in software engineering you want to do yet, this program might be the right fit for you.</p>
