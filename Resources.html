									<p>Have you developed an interest in software engineering from this guide? If you want to start learning more about software engineering, or would like some resources to get you going, below are three of the most popular sites used by software engineers to answer any technical questions they may have. Click on the titles for links to their home pages. Happy programming!</p>

									<h2><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/">XDA-Developers</a></h2>
									<p>XDA-Developers is a forum for all those software and hardware engineers that specialize in Android application development. While that may at first seem like a niche market, Android apps are highly versatile and it's fun to learn the ins and outs of your smartphone. You can post any questions you may have to the forums, and they have handy articles full of tips and tricks for how to break into root on your phone and customize it to your heart's content. </p>

									<h2><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></h2>
									<p>Stack Overflow is one of those sites where, as a programmer, you'll end up there eventually looking for a solution to a problem, whether you like it or not. Cheekily named after an annoyingly common error programmers run into when they write their code incorrectly, Stack Overflow is the place to go if you have a question about any programming subject that exists in the world. If you don't know what to do, there's a high probability Stack Overflow will have the answer you seek. You can check it out, or wait until you inevitably get stuck on a programming error and Stack Overflow will come to you.</p>

									<h2><a href="http://forum.codecall.net/">Codecall Programming Forum</a></h2>
									<p>Similar to Stack Overflow, Codecall if a forum where you can find answers to various programming-based questions, get some homework help for coding classes, and kick back and relax in an off-topic forum where you can chat with fellow programmers about any topic under the sun. This site is more laid back than the previous two mentioned, but it serves well as a no-judegement place to ask the questions you may feel to embarrassed to ask on other forums that have a more professional vibe. It also contains some solid posts about general topics, such as programming basics not tied to a specific language, and even software security basics. If you're looking for a place to start your programming adventures, this may be the right fit for you.</p>
